Angler Shop (formally "No Fishing Quests"), Adds two shop buttons to the Angler. 
One Button is to buy utility items and equipment and the other for decorative items and vanity sets.

Now you can get your Cell Phone without needing to fish endlessly! For more info visit my homepage!
The Quest button is still there.

If you still like to complete quests but also want to be able to buy the items, you can toggle a setting in the mod Config.
This will enable a custom currency that the Angler shop uses and which you can get by completing fishing quests.

The items Fin Wings and Hotline Fishing Hook are only available once in hardmode - just like fishing quest rewards.
